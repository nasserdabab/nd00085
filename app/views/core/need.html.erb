  When you join the Club and start to learn how to play the game you do not need to be involved in any expense as far as equipment is concerned.<br><br>

  Initially you can borrow a club mallet and use it until you are sure that you like the game and until you know what sort of mallet you want to buy for your 
  personal use. The only requirement to start with is that you should wear flat-soled shoes on the lawn to avoid damage.<br><br>

  When you start playing in matches it is suggested that you get "whites" to play in as this is the accepted norm for matches and tournament play<br><br>
